# Portfolio
Welcome to My Portfolio!

Iâ€™m Arvind Kumar, a passionate and driven final-year BTech student specializing in Full Stack Development with a keen interest in Data Science and Generative AI. This portfolio showcases the projects and technologies I have worked with, highlighting my journey in software development.

From building intuitive web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to solving complex algorithmic challenges, I thrive on creating solutions that address real-world problems. In this space, you will find a collection of my academic, personal, and collaborative projects, each reflecting my skills, dedication, and love for coding.

Feel free to explore the projects, technologies, and my journey. I'm constantly looking to grow, innovate, and contribute to impactful work in the tech industry.
